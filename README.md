## Project 1: Data Warehousing and Association Rule Mining

### Result: 45/50

## Outline of the project
The project focuses on performing data warehousing techniques on real crime datasets to answer some business queries. 

## Data Warehousing Design and Implementation
- Think about a few business questions that my data warehouse could help answer.
- Draw a StarNet with the aim to identify the dimensions and concept hierarchies for each dimension. This should be based on the lowest level of information I can access to.
- Use the StarNet footprints to illustrate how the business queries can be answered with my design.
- Once the StarNet diagram is completed, draw it using a tool or software - in this project, diagram.net was used, and paste it into PowerBI
- Implement a star schema using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and paste the database ER diagram generated by SSMS onto Power BI Dashboard.
- Load the data from the CSV files to populate the tables by using the SQL code command
- Use SQL Server Data Tools to build a multi-dimensional analysis service solution, with a cube designed to answer my business queries. Make sure the concept hierarchies match StarNet design. Paste the cube diagram to your Power BI Dashboard.
- Use Power BI to visualise the data returned from the business queries.
